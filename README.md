# MOTIF_LP

1. The complex networks are sampled using read.py
2. The properties of sampled networks are determined using density.py
3. The simple version of the proposed motif-based link prediction metric (and its variants) is coded in metric.py (and metric2.py and metric3.py)
4. The signed version of the proposed motif-based link prediction metric (and its variants) is coded in metric_sign.py (and metric_sign2.py)
5. The visualizations are generated using viz.py (and plot.py and plot2.py)
